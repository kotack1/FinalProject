Project Title: Seasonality of Cetacean Species Richness in California
Project Description: From July 2004 thru April 2008, marine mammal surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations
(CalCOFI) were conducted in order to understand the spatial distribution of marine fauna off the coast of califronia. Through this dataset,
we sought to understand how marine mammals shifted their movement behavior based on seasonality. We have condcuted a series of distribution 
and density analysis through ArcGIS Pro and python.

Dataset Title: CalCOFI marine mammal surveys 2004-2008 - on effort
Dataset Source: OBIS-SEAMAP
Date Data Acquired: 10/09/2024
Dataset Citation: Douglas, A. 2012. CalCOFI marine mammal surveys 2004-2008 - on effort. Data downloaded from OBIS-SEAMAP (http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/792) on 2024-10-09.

Dataset Description: From July 2004 to April 2008 dedicated visual observers following consistent line-transect methods (Buckland et al., 1993; Kinzey et al., 2003) observed from the CalCOFI platforms
on quarterly cruises. Observers used handheld 7X50 reticle Fujinon binoculars to sight, identify, and make school size estimates of cetaceans and pinnipeds encountered along the transect lines between
CalCOFI water sampling stations. The southern water sampling stations are set along six, parallel lines running southwest to northeast, with lines increasing in length from north to south (470 â€“ 700 km)
and stations occurring every 37 km in coastal and continental shelf waters and every 74 km offshore. Three research vessels were used for the sixteen surveys, Scripps Institution of Oceanography Roger 
Revelle (2 surveys) and New Horizon (8 surveys) and, NOAA David Starr Jordan (6 surveys), vessel height varied from 8.1-13.2m and survey speed varied from 10 to 12 knots.
